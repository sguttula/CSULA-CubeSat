1. Simplat consists of a server and a physical moveable platform (omni wheels and servos).

2. To Run SimPlat, execute the following command in the terminal of SimPlat's raspberry pi:Â  Python3 csCodeV5.py

3. This will have SimPlat waiting for a connection to execute a given command. The connection can be either from CubeSat autonomous mode or Ground Systems manual mode.

4. Once the SimPlat is running and a connection has been made, a print line will show that the device has made a connection to either CubeSat or Ground System.
