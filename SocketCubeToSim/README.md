1. SocketCubeToSim folder contains 2 files ; the client/CubeSat as well as the server/SimPlat.

2. Both of these files are used for testing purposes when the actual SimPlat and/or CubeSat is not present.

3. Run the simPlat/server, followed by the client/CubeSat. Once a connection has been made a print statement will confirm. Once connected client/CubeSat can send typed commands to the SimPlat.
